# Getting Started with Q Task

On this application I fetched posts from API. Using the Search bar, you can search for posts based on the user who wrote them. You can also click on the post, and in that case a new page will open displaying that post. In the console, the variable 'Hello from' + the name of the component is displayed. I used typescript + styled components with which I wrote styles for components, as well as global styles and themes.

## Packages I used
[Styled Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)\
[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)\
[React Spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can install packages:

### `yarn`
\
And Than run

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
